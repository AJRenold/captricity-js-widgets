Captricit JavaScript Widgets
=====================

This is a barebones single-page example of a set of JavaScript widgets that
will allow you to: 

* Get the account information associated with an API key
* List all Documents in a Captricity account
* Create a new Job with an existing Document
* Create a new InstanceSet in that Job 
* Upload an Instance to that InstanceSet
* Submit your Job

These widgets are implemented with the Captricity Schema.js library.

# Usage

1. Visit http://captricity.github.com/captricity-js-widgets
2. Make sure you have the API key for your account (you'll find it in your Captricity developer setup email)

# Caveats

You must use a one-page template for the instance uploader to work as expected.
